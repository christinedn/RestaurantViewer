# Write up
1. How long did you spend working on the problem? What did you find to be the most difficult part?
- I spent about 5 hours working on the project. Figuring out how the location manager works was challenging for me because I haven’t dealt with anything like it before. I struggled to grasp what was happening behind the scenes. To get a better understanding, I’d need to do more research into how apps request access to a user’s location and how permissions are handled.

2. What trade-offs did you make? What did you choose to spend time on, and what did you choose to ignore or do quickly for the sake of completing the project?
- I chose to focus on the important parts of the project, for example implementing the stack of cards as well as the logic behind how the stack of cards would be displayed as the user clicked the previous and next button. I also wanted to use more of my time on managing the structure of my files, using the MVVM architecture for organizing code and for future reusability.
